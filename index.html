                <p>OpenID Connect is an interoperable authentication protocol based on the OAuth 2.0 framework of
                    specifications (IETF RFC 6749 and 6750). It simplifies the way to verify the identity of users based
                    on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server and to obtain user profile information in
                    an interoperable and REST-like manner.</p>

                <p>Encryption is a way of converting plaintext into ciphertext (an encoded text that is not
                    understandable by the third party). Encryption requires the use of an encryption key and an
                    encryption algorithm. The key is used to encrypt/decrypt the plaintext into ciphertext. How that key
                    is used to encrypt the plaintext is defined by the encryption algorithm. Both the receiver and the
                    sender must have the encryption key.</p>
                <p>
                    SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificates create an encrypted environment between a client and a
                    server. A Secure Sockets Layer certificate (SSL certificate) is a small data file installed on a Web
                    server that allows for a secure connection between the server and a web browser.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In HTTPS, before transferring any data, the client first verifies that the server it is talking to
                    is the correct server and how the data will be encrypted. This process is called the TLS handshake.

                    HTTP cookies, or web cookies, are small text files that store small pieces of information. They are
                    created by the websites we visit and are stored on our browser. Cookies are limited to 4kb in size,
                    which means they cannot store large amounts of data.

                <p>Chart.js comes with built-in TypeScript typings and is compatible with all popular JavaScript
                    frameworks including React , Vue , Svelte , and Angular . You can use Chart.js directly or leverage
                    well-maintained wrapper packages that allow for a more native integration with your frameworks of
                    choice.</p>
                <p>
                    Chart.js renders chart elements on an HTML5 canvas unlike several others, mostly D3.js-based,
                    charting libraries that render as SVG. Canvas rendering makes Chart.js very performant, especially
                    for large datasets and complex visualizations that would otherwise require thousands of SVG nodes in
                    the DOM tree.

                    Okta has Authentication and User Management APIs that reduce development time with instant-on,
                    scalable user infrastructure. Okta's intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to
                    authenticate, manage and secure users and roles in any application.

                <p>
                    Angular is quickly becoming one of the most powerful ways to build a
                    modern single-page app. A core strength is Angular’s focus on building reusable components, which
                    help you decouple the various concerns in your application. Take authentication, for example: it can
                    be painful to build, but once you wrap it in a component, the authentication logic can be reused
                    throughout your application.
